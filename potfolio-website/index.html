  <p class="body-text">Travelling has been a part of my life from a very young age. With both parents in the army, I had to move cities a lot, change schools and meet people from all over the country. India is a country with so much diversity and as I grew up getting to know people from around the country I began to enjoy cultures and differences and try new experiences more and more. This website is a way of me being able to document my love for travel and all the wonderful experiences that I capture through photos and posts. I want people to be able to look into the different and unique parts of India through a window into my experiences.</p>
