       <p>My motto as a designer is Impact. Innovate & Design. I want to be a part of an organization that believes in making an impact on the way people see and perceive the world. Companies working in the field of Innovation aim to make life easier for people through well thought out design. The combination of my experience in Design, knowledge of computers and interest in business and entrepreneurship studies is the strength with which I hope to join a Design and Innovation Team. Designing for big business can be tricky. But what is important to me is to be part of an organization that at its core is experimental and willing to take risks.  The core of building something epic is failing and learning from every mistake. I believe the best ideas are born from taking risks.

       <p>I am a UX designer, marketer, and current dual-degree graduate student at the University of Michigan finishing a MSI in Human-Computer Interaction at the School of Information and a MBA in Marketing at the Ross School of Business. I love research and design because it allows me to tap into my inherent curiosity and my willingness to seek out the causes of problems and wade in messiness, before finally creating potential solutions. I enjoy both the Research and Design aspects of UX, as Research allows me to "Understand" before doing the "Creation" of Design.
