    <h1> Final project</h1>
    <p><em>- by Vibhuti Kanitkar</em><p>
    <h4><em> Analysing accesibility for Quality Assurance</em>
    <a href="https://events.umich.edu/?q=euwfbqu%20">Michigan events Website</a><h4>

   <h3>Run through each page with the WAVE Chrome Extension.</h3>
   <li>The page has 30 errors wave errors.</li>
   <li>29 links are inaccurately linke.</li>
   <li>There is one broken skip link.</li>
   <p style="width:700px;">Solution: If a link contains no text, the function or purpose of the link will not be presented to the user. This can introduce confusion for keyboard and screen reader users. They should remove the empty link or provide text within the link that describes the functionality and/or target of that link.</p><br>

   <h3>Users should be able to navigate through content using their keyboard</h3>
   <li>The page is accessible through tab indexing and can navigate to pages</li><br>


   <h3>Users should be able to navigate content using a screen reader.</h3>
   <li>The voiceover does not work effectively on this website. Most of the voiceover only gives code indication of the web content you are hovering over.</li>
   <p style="width:700px;">Solution: They can make the website more accessible and easy to use for screen readers by adding alt text to images and also adding aria labels to the content</p><br>

   <h3>The general architecture and hierarchy of the content should make sense.</h3>
   <li>There is a consistency in maintenance of how headers are placed and how tittle and subtitles are laid out.</li><br>

   <h3>Charts and images should all have alt-text so that users with screen readers or users on a slow connection will still be able to understand the images.</h3>
   <li>The page does not have a good alt text or navigation. The voice over is broken and as suggested earlier the page needs more aria labels and also alt text for images. </li>
